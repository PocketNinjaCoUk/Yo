  <p>This build uses a few gulp plugins to render the Javascript.  If you just want to start using Yo without the
    additional gulp.  Just download the minified version and follow the instructions on initialising it.</p>
  <p>Then write whatever code you want without worrying about dependencies and any large files as it's all raw
    Javascript and gives you the freedom to be creative yourself.</p>
