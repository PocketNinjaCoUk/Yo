# Dependency on a single page script

Using gulp to import javascript files into 1 file and provide clean dependencies

### To install

Download the repo and run

```
$ npm install
```

The main gulp command is to simply run

```
$ gulp
```

This imports javascript into 1 file and copies it to a public folder along with the index html page.  You're now ready to get on to working with this.  Let's do it :-P
